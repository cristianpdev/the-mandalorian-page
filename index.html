            <p class="p-article">The Mandalorian occurs after the fall of the Empire, as depicted in Return of the Jedi,
                and before the emergence of the First Order, depicted in The Force Awakens, which tells the story of an
                independent Mandalorian bounty hunter "in the far reaches of the galaxy, far away from the authority of
                the New Republic, always looking for ways to make improvements to his armor, until on a mission he ends
                up finding a mysterious being who needs his help, called Grogu, also known as "The Child", and chooses
                to run to protect the baby.While in their quest to learn more about Grogu's origins, they are pursued by
                Moff Gideon.</p>

            <p class="p-article">The series is filmed at Manhattan Beach Studios in California Filoni directed the
                series' first episode, making his live-action directorial debut with Rick Famuyiwa, Deborah
                Chow, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Taika Waititi also directing for the first season. Filoni,
                Howard, and Famuyiwa returned for the second season, and are joined by Favreau, who was unable
                to direct in the first season due to his commitments to The Lion King, Peyton Reed, co-star Carl
                Weathers, and Robert Rodriguez.</p>
            <p class="p-article">In February 2021, Lucasfilm said Gina Carano, a recurring co-star during the first two
                seasons, was no
                longer employed by the company. This came after Carano made a social media post comparing being a
                Republican in the United States to the treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust, with Lucasfilm
                saying the post was "abhorrent and unacceptable". Carano had been repeatedly warned about her social
                media posts by Lucasfilm executives who reportedly had been looking for a reason to fire her for two
                months. The February 2021 posts were "the final straw", and the decision to fire the actress was made by
                Lucasfilm executives rather than Favreau. The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek said Carano was
                fired because her posts did not align with the values of Disney, which he said were "universal" and not
                political.The Hollywood Reporter reported that Carano's role of Cara Dune was not expected to be
                recast, though industry insiders felt that was still a possibility due to story and merchandising
                reasons. </p>
